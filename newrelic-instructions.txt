To enable New Relic monitoring in a Next.js app on Vercel, you must run a custom server (not supported on Vercel's default serverless platform).

If you deploy to your own Node.js server, add this as the first line of your server entry point (e.g., server.js):

require('newrelic');

For Vercel, you can use New Relic's browser monitoring by injecting the browser agent in your _app.tsx or _document.tsx, or use Vercel Analytics for serverless monitoring.

Replace 'YOUR_NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY' in newrelic.js with your actual license key.
